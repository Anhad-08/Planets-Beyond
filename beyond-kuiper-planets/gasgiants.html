                Gliese 436 b /ˈɡliːzə/ (sometimes called GJ 436 b, formally named Awohali ) is a Neptune-sized exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 436.
                It was the first hot Neptune discovered with certainty (in 2007) and was among the smallest-known transiting planets in mass and radius,
                until the much smaller Kepler exoplanet discoveries began circa 2010. In December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b.
                This planet has ice formations called Ice-7 and
                as the gravity compresses the ice and the its sun evaporates the water, it leaves behind a comet-like tail 9 million miles long.

            <p >
                HD 189733 b is an exoplanet in the constellation of Vulpecula approximately 64.5 light-years (19.8 parsecs) away from the Solar System.
                Astronomers in France discovered the planet orbiting the star HD 189733 on October 5, 2005, by observing its transit across the star's face.
                With a mass 11.2% higher than that of Jupiter and a radius 11.4% greater,
                HD 189733 b orbits its host star once every 2.2 days at an orbital speed of 152.0 kilometers per second (152,000 meters per second; 340,000 miles per hour),
                making it a hot Jupiter with poor prospects for extraterrestrial life

                WASP-121b, formally named Tylos, is an exoplanet orbiting the star WASP-121.
                WASP-121b is the first exoplanet found to contain water in an extrasolar planetary stratosphere (i.e., an atmospheric layer in which temperatures increase as the altitude increases).
                WASP-121b is in the constellation Puppis, and is about 858 light-years from Earth.
                WASP-121b is a hot Jupiter exoplanet with a mass about 1.16 times that of Jupiter and a radius about 1.75 times that of Jupiter.
                The exoplanet orbits WASP-121, its host star, every 1.27 days. On this extreme planet it can rain liquid gemstone.

            <p >
                WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter (a class of extrasolar planets) orbiting the star WASP-12, discovered in April of 2008, by the SuperWASP planetary transit survey.
                Its distance from the star (approximately 3.5 million kilometers [2.2 million miles; 0.023 astronomical units]) is only 1/43 the Earth's distance from the Sun.
                The planet is so close to its star that its tidal forces are distorting it into an egg shape and pulling away its atmosphere. WASP-12b reflects just 6% of the light that shines on its surface
                As a result, the exoplanet has been described as "black as asphalt" and as "pitch black."
