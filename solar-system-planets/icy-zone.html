                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's
                mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined
                and slightly less than one one-thousandths the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance
                of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 Earth years. It is the third brightest natural
                object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric
                times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is
                a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth
                the average density of Earth, over 95 times the mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU
                (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 Earth years.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet
                is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, astronomy calls "ice" or
                volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum
                temperature of 49 K (-224&degC; -371&degF) out of all the Solar System's planets. It has a
                marked axial tilt of 82.23&deg with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This
                means that in its 84 Earth year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get 42 years of continuous
                sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

            <p >
                Neptune is the eigth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the
                Solar System by diameter, the third-largest by mass, and the densest gas giant planet. It is 17 times
                the mass of Earth and slightly more massive than fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser and
                physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes greater gravitational compression of
                its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surfaces.
                The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 Earth years at an orbital distance of 30.1 AU (4.5
                billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles).
